                            On a professional level, Iâ€™ve also gained valuable, hands-on experience for software development practices after my time at theScore. I worked as a QA analyst for the promotions team, where I got the chance to test and find bugs for their upcoming features. I participated in daily standups, created concise testing notes, filed bugs, and made lasting connections with some amazing people!
